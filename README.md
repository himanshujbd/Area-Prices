This ML script had been written in jupyter notebook which is installed on my mac machine. So before running this script you must install following libraries.

1- Jupyter Notebook with python 3 installed.
2- Pandas 
3- sklearn

if you have installed all the above libraries and jupyter notebook, now you're good to go. Happy Coding.
